<h1>Project</h1>
Your assignment is to use the die rolling function and an input loop together to make a magic 8-ball like game where players roll a die, and then get a corresponding fortune from the 8-ball.
<br><br>
Example Program Output:
<br>
Welcome to your fortune teller! I know how good your future will be, based on your own luck! If you’re lucky, you’ll have a lucky outcome. 
<br>
Tell me to “roll” when you’re ready to roll the dice for your future.
<ul>
  <li>if the player rolls a low amount, give them have a bad fortune.</li>
  <li>if the player rolls a medium amount, give them a good fortune.</li>
  <li>if the player rolls a high amount, give them a great fortune.</li>
</ul>
Extra Credit: 
<ul>
  <li>If someone rolls the highest amount possible, tell them they won the lottery</li>
</ul>

If you can, build the entire above program before continuing on, but after you click continue here there will be a few prompts that will help you figure out what code you'll need, and define the program more specifically!
<br>
Press continue for some prompts and additional information!
<br>
Come up with a solution to the following prompts. You can write it out in a regular sentence, and that will help you design your program. Check the boxes when you've come up with an answer.
<ul>
  <li>Decide how many different fortunes you want to have. 3? 6? 100?</li>
  <li>What should the range of the random number you create be?</li>
  <li>How can you check if the user inputs "roll" so you can start?</li>
  <li>What happens if the user says something, or misspells "roll"—how can you let them try again, or tell you they want to "exit".</li>
  <li>You might want to use a function for something that could be done multiple times, like rolling a die, and getting a fortune.</li>
  <li>What if the user wants to get multiple fortunes, without running the program again, what code feature would you use to solve that?</li>
</ul>
There's a lot of ways to build up the program. No one approach is correct, but after you get it working in a basic way, keep pushing to see what else you can get it to do. 
<br>
Also you can use these same skills to create a game where the user guesses a random number, and if they're right you could give them a reward! If they're wrong you could charge them money, and then you've got the makings of a casino!
