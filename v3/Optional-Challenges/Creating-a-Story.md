<b>A New Program</b>
<br>
Now that you've reviewed the basics of Python programming, you'll create a program that can tell your user a story, but only if they know the secret password!
<h1>Need a Refresher?</h1>
1. Before you write the code, plan out a story.
<br>
2. Create a new project called "UserStory".
<br>
3. Write a 6â€“8 line story that you'll use for the rest of the project.
<br><br>
Here are seven lines about a happy dragon who becomes sad:
<ol>
  <li>Once upon a time, there was a happy dragon.</li>
  <li>The dragon lived by the sea.</li>
  <li>He ate trees and bushes.</li>
  <li>People thought the dragon was too happy.</li>
  <li>The people sent Geoff, the village's butcher, to fight the dragon.</li>
  <li>The dragon thought that sounded unpleasant, so he left the sea.</li>
  <li>Now he lives in the city and eats the trees and bushes there instead.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Printing the Story</h1>
Now translate your story into code.
Use <code>print()</code> to print the first line of your story to the console window:
<pre>print("First line of your story")</pre>
Continue to use <code>print()</code> to send the remaining lines of your story to the console window.
<h1>Story Topics</h1>
Write the story about something important to you. It doesn't have to be dragons, it could be a diary about your day or something you just make up!
<h1>Recap</h1>
Plan out a short story. Use <code>print()</code> commands to print your story line by line.
<br>
Use escape characters in a creative way to format your story the way you want.
