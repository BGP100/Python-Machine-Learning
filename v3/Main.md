<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Before you get started, you'll want to read through the iD Code, either with your instructor, or independently.
<br>
We want you to learn and have a blast! Here are a couple of reminders so you can have the best experience ever.
<br>
Let's get started!
<h1>Getting Started and Setup</h1>
The first thing that needs to be covered is setting up your computer. All of the programs should already be installed and ready to go for you, but you'll need a place that's yours on the computer to store everything for this week.
<h2>Your Folder</h2>
Throughout this course, you're going to be creating some cool projects, but before you can do that, you'll need to create a folder to put all of these projects in. Throughout the curriculum if you're instructed to "save your work" or "put a file into your student folder" this will be the place to store those!
