<h1>Your First Game</h1>
Now, test your knowledge by completing a Guess the Number game coding challenge!
<br>

<br>
In this challenge, you'll be making a guess the number game. Your program will generate a random number and then ask the user to guess what it is. 
<br>
When they guess wrong, your program will tell them if they are too high or too low.
<h2>Core Features Breakdown:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Generate a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
  <li>Let the user guess what the number is until they get it right.</li>
  <li>Give the user feedback after each guess- tell them if their guess is too high, too low, or just right.</li>
  <li>Begin the game again.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Features:</h2>
Have some extra time? Try adding one of these extra features to your game!
<ul>
  <li>Use a variable to track how many guesses the user has made already. When they win, tell them how many tries it took.</li>
  <li>Let your user set the upper bound or choose a difficulty mode. Maybe instead of guessing a number between 1 and 100, they have to guess between 1 and 1000!</li>
  <li>Add another loop to let the user restart the game after they win.</li>
  <li>In addition to generating a random number that the user is trying to guess, generate a second random death number that the user is trying to avoid. If the user guesses the death number, it's game over!</li>
  <li>Create a function for code that you use a lot such as getting user input or generating a random number.</li>
</ul>
