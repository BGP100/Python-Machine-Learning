Just like with every other network, you can spend some time playing with the network you have created and running images through it. You can use this notebook for an outline of the tests to run.
<br>
Try some of these challenges to help see what your new network can do.
<ul>
  <li>Put a randomly generated image through the network. Can you notice any patterns about what the predictions are?</li>
  <li>Run an image of one of the classes through the network. Can the network recognize them?</li>
  <li>Test the network with some images from the train_images dataset.</li>
</ul>
