<h1>Pushing Further</h1>
Now that you have a lot of basics, classes, functions, random numbers, and input, you can do a lot!
<br>
Work on putting everything you have together into one big game! Imagine a game where a player can create pet robots, and then have them fight! Or it can have them help each other out, using special 'helpful' moves to accomplish goals together.
<br>
After all, if you can make a variable that does 'damage', then you can also make a variable that does 'building points' and helps construct something!
<br>
In games like Pokemon you capture little animals, and then you have them fight other animals until they're ready to be captured. You've got the skills to make a game in the console that has that functionality!
<br>

<br>
Try to break down what a game like that would need. You'd probably need a few classes, for players, and animals, and then like the magic 8-ball you'd probably want to select between a few different moves and have them do different amounts of damage, or healing to other creatures.
<br>
If you've got a good idea of how to build that program, dive right in! Plan out as you go, and you'll soon learn how to best work through problems, and what you should think through before you start coding.
<br>
But, sometimes the hardest thing is to know where to start. If you'd like some guidance click the button below, and go through the prompts to help guide you!
<br>
Think about what mechanic is most important to you. Is it the interactions between animals, or is it how the player finds them or makes them in the world? (Robot-animal-builder-making!)
<br>
1. Start with what's most exciting to you. You could spend hours coding player health and damage, but if you really want to get to the action, start with that instead!
<br>
2. With your focus in mind, think about the first thing you'd need. Is it how stats are randomly assigned, or is it the funny text options for how animals interact?
<br>
3. Build just that small part, whatever you're most excited about, and whatever the first step to making that is. Then, think about what's next right after that, until the feature is completed!
<br>
It's important not to overwhelm yourself trying to do everything, so by focusing like this you'll stay engaged and make programs faster than you'd think.

A player should be able to: Create a robot animal, Heal the robot animal, Hold multiple animals and switch between them.

<br>
The animals should be able to: Choose from four moves, Have health, speed, and damage, Moves alter another animal's stats.

The interactions should be:
Player can start a fight between their own animal and another, and if the player wins the fight, the player's animal gets stronger!

You can look at all the lessons you've already gone through to help too. 
<ul>
  <li>Classes will help you make players and animals</li>
  <li>If statements and conditionals will help you make moves</li>
  <li>Variables will help you make stats and alter them</li>
  <li>Functions will help you organize how everything interacts</li>
</ul>
