Now that you understand the basics of creating a model, it's time to play with it and see what you can change.
<br>
Follow this checklist of challenges to complete with your network.
<ul>
  <li>Add another calculation layer. Write down how the accuracy and loss. How is it different than with just one calculation layer?</li>
  <li>Run the model with only one epoch. How does the accuracy change?</li>
  <li>Try to crash the runtime by making a network too big or too slow.</li>
  <li>What happens if you change the input shape? What about epochs?</li>
  <li>Can you get the test accuracy to be higher? What do you need to change?</li>
  <li>Make the output shape for a layer super large or super small. How does that affect the test accuracy? What about the amount of time the model takes to run?</li>
</ul>
