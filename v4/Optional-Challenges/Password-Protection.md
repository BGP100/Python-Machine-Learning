<h1>User Input</h1>
<br>
You created a secret or an important story.
<br>
Now use the <code>input()</code> command to let the user enter a password, or they don't get to read what you wrote!

<b>Collecting Input</b>
<br>
Write a prompt and save, as a string, the user's response to a password variable.
<br>
Make sure to put this code above where the story is printed.

<br>
1. Create a strong password variable.
<br>
2. Prompt the user to type the password and save their response:
<pre>password = input("What's the password?")</pre>
3. If the password is correct, display the story. Otherwise, tell them they got the password wrong, and cannot see the story.
<br><br>
<b>Making it Your Own</b>
<br>
Keep thinking how you could make your real story more secure, and only let people you want to read it see the full thing.

<b>What would happen if you made a "fake" story and a "fake" password, so it would seem like the program worked, but it didn't output your real secret story?</b>
