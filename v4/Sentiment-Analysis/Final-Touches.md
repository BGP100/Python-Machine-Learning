Edit your webpage styling and content. Add more information about your website and adjust the style by updating the font, background, or adding more stylistic elements.
<br>
Use <a href="https://mywebpagestyled.latteidtech.repl.co">this website</a> as an example.
<ul>
  <li>Add backgrounds to the reviews to make them more readable.</li>
  <li>Select a font-family for the text on the page.</li>
  <li>Add colors, different padding and margins, and anything else to adjust the page to look like you want.</li>
</ul>

Use a different webpage or new text as a test of the network. Re-create the import and set-up for the model, and then use different text to test out the power of your model. 
<br>
Think about what potential gaps your model might have and how you could help make it more effective.
<ul>
  <li>Follow the same process to create or collect text for the network.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to clean and vectorize your input.</li>
  <li>Use the same graph function, or create a new one to understand the output.</li>
</ul>

Adjust the network and re-train it. If you have some ideas about what might make your network more effective, this is a chance to see if you can improve it!
<ul>
  <li>Adjust the network by adding new layers, changing the epochs or anything else you want.
  <li>You can also change the data that the network is trained with, or simply train it again to see what the differences are.
</ul>
